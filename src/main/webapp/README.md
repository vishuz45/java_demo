For This CI/CD Task I made the project of maven
In this project first of all i made the configuration and installation of jenkins on ubuntu server using cloud service ec2 of AWS
i launch one sevrer using name jenkins 
after the installation of jenkins i made one maven project in jenkins and make its configuration
after that i setup git and make one repo in github 
for connectivity of github and jenkins i used the concept of github "webhook"
i connect jenkins and github with webhook so it can work when i push the code it will going to run directly on jenkins 
for this work to implement this project ,in jenkins project configuration i download the plugins which we need to execute for this task 
i installed this plugins like maven plugins from the jenkins plugins section 
after this i setup inportant build in process put git repo code link in project configuration giving proper bild commands like root pom 
for this we are build file pom.xml
after all this configuration and setups i did simple coding in html language
after the push from git the code goes in gihub repo and with help of webhook it trigger in jenkins project and concole output come as success
after this all i made testing building configuration in jenkins for this i used "maven" for build the code and also for testing used "junit"
so after code get test and build successfully i deployed it on tomcat sevrers
i made installation of tomcat on jenkins server that i launched in aws after this installation 
after all this aur maven give the output of our code in .war file which we are going to use it for deployment 
so after add this all .war files and tomcat links in jenkins project configuration 
i successfully deployed it on live sevrer 

so all the screenshots of this project i send you in one pdf file 


thank so much looking forward for your responce 


REPORT FOR THIS PROJECT 

Introduction
This report provides an overview of the CI/CD process implemented for a sample application, discussing the tool choices and scalability options for larger applications. 
The tools used include Jenkins, Git, GitHub, Apache Tomcat, Maven, and JUnit


CI/CD Process Overview
The CI/CD process automates the building, testing, and deployment of software. 
It ensures that code changes are integrated and tested frequently, 
leading to higher quality and faster delivery of applications.

Tools Used:

Jenkins: Jenkins is used as the CI/CD automation server. It is responsible for the entire CI/CD pipeline, including building, testing, and deployment.

Git/GitHub: Git is used for version control, and GitHub is used as the remote repository . 
Git/GitHub enables collaboration among team members and provides version history.

Apache Tomcat: Apache Tomcat is used as the application server for deploying the web application. It hosts the application and serves HTTP requests.

Maven: Maven is used as the build automation tool. 
It manages project dependencies and builds the application, creating deployable artifacts such as WAR files.

JUnit: JUnit is used as the unit testing framework for Java applications. I
t is used to write and execute unit tests to ensure the quality of the code
CI/CD Process Steps:

Source Code Management = Developers commit code changes to the Git repository hosted on GitHub.

Continuous Integration = Jenkins monitors the Git repository for changes. Upon detecting a new commit, Jenkins triggers a build process using Maven.

Build: Maven downloads project dependencies, compiles the source code, runs unit tests using JUnit, and packages the application into a WAR file.

Automated Testing: JUnit is used for automated unit testing to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements.

Deployment: Jenkins deploys the WAR file to the Apache Tomcat server for hosting the application.

Continuous Deployment = The deployment to the Tomcat server is automated, ensuring that the latest version of the application is always available for testing or production use.

Scalability for Larger Applications:
For larger applications, the CI/CD setup can be scaled by implementing the following strategies:

Parallel Builds: Jenkins can be configured to run builds in parallel, allowing multiple builds to run concurrently, thereby reducing build times for large projects.
Distributed Builds: Jenkins supports distributed builds, where build jobs can be distributed across multiple build nodes .
This helps distribute the build workload and scale the CI/CD process horizontally.
Artifact Repository: Use an artifact repository manager to store build artifacts. This helps in managing dependencies and sharing artifacts across teams.
Environment Provisioning: Use tools like Docker and Kubernetes for environment provisioning .
This enables the creation of isolated environments for testing and deployment, ensuring consistency across environments
